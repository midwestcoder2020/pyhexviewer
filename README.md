# pyhexviewer

This project provides two scripts which can be used as CLI hex viewers. Simply start the script and enter the file name when prompted. From there press 'enter' to keep scrolling or 'q' to quit the program.


## Contains 2x versions; hexviewer and hewviewer lite

### Hexviewer loads the entire thing into memory before viewing

### Hexviewerlite creates the handle and interator which is the memory friendly approach
